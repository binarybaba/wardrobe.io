# Chat App 


Webapp that imitates a chat app.

`yarn`, `yarn dev`.

`eslint` might need node >= 10

Problems:
There was a conflict with eslint's version so I had to ditch the CRA inspired repo.
Ended up using a repo I had made for webpack+angular a year ago and made changes for the build process for react.
You can see the diffs.

I couldn't finish things up in time so I coded some components so you get an Idea how I approach my solutions.

Ideally, I wanted to have a store and dispatch actions to the store. It's not done yet. Could be done later on but
I _will_ need more than refactor time since its been ages I configured a store too.
I'm glad if you wanna watch while I do it but you gotta be patient :D

Styles we NOT added since I ran out of time. but the layout has been added.

I used an hour yesterday to configure the build process and about 2.5 hours today where I actually coded with
some distractions.

Lemme know! Cheers!
